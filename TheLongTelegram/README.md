## The Weight of History

It's 1946. The guns of World War II have barely cooled. Two superpowers now face each other across a divided world, and every decision you make could tip the balance toward peace—or nuclear annihilation.

**The Long Telegram** puts you in the Oval Office or the Kremlin during the most dangerous years of the Cold War. Named after George Kennan's famous 8,000-word diplomatic cable that shaped American foreign policy, this is a game about the choices that shaped our world.

## Choose Your Doctrine

Select from **eight historical advisors**, each unlocking a unique path to victory:

### United States
- **George Kennan** — The architect of containment. Patient pressure, no direct confrontation.
- **Curtis LeMay** — Peace through superior firepower. The Strategic Air Command is your hammer.
- **Henry Wallace** — The peace candidate. Can diplomacy alone win the Cold War?
- **Dean Acheson** — The diplomat's diplomat. NATO is your shield.

### Soviet Union
- **Marshal Konev** — The Hammer. Secure satellites through overwhelming force.
- **Vyacheslav Molotov** — The Stone Wall. Divide the West, block their every move.
- **Lavrentiy Beria** — The Spymaster. Destabilize from within.
- **Maxim Litvinov** — The Old Guard. Build socialism in one country.

Each advisor transforms the game's aesthetics, victory conditions, and strategic options.

## Key Features

### Asymmetric Superpowers
The USA spends **Political Capital**—Congressional support is hard won and easily lost. The USSR spends **State Control**—the Politburo demands results. Same world, different constraints.

### Living History
Experience pivotal moments: The Iron Curtain Speech. The Berlin Blockade. The Soviet Bomb. The Korean War. Each event offers choices that reshape the board.

### The Red Phone
When crises erupt, you'll face impossible choices. Back down and lose prestige? Escalate and risk war? Every response carries consequences you won't fully understand until it's too late.

### Your Allies Have Agendas
Client states aren't puppets. Arm them too much and they'll drag you into wars you didn't start. The "Patron's Dilemma" forces you to choose: back your ally, or cut them loose?

### Fog of War
You'll never know exactly how close you are to triggering World War III. Intelligence briefings give hints, but the true threshold remains hidden. Are you containing communism—or stumbling toward armageddon?

### The Desk Decays
As tension rises, your world changes. Papers pile up. Ashtrays overflow. The lights dim. By Turn 20, you'll feel the weight of every decision in the atmosphere around you.

## Three Command Centers

Navigate the Cold War from three distinct views:

| Room | Your Focus |
|------|------------|
| **War Room** | The world map. Deploy influence, manage crises, watch the dominoes. |
| **Domestic Desk** | Guns or butter? Allocate budgets, manage resources, keep your coalition together. |
| **Intelligence Hub** | Read the morning papers. Decode the secret cables. Separate signal from noise. |

---

## The Morning Briefing

Each turn begins with a classified intelligence summary delivered in period-accurate style—manila folders marked "TOP SECRET" for the USA, red leather dossiers stamped "СОВЕРШЕННО СЕКРЕТНО" for the USSR.

Your analysts will tell you what they *think* is happening. Whether they're right is another matter.
